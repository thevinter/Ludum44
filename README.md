## A game made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 44
### Description:
_“It’s been twelve years since that day. But i still remember it as if it was yesterday. Fire, screams, explosions and blood._

_I’ve crossed mountains, woods and rivers, but now i’m close. This roulotte will be my last refuge, tonight i’ll sleep in a bed. New Nuric, the Promised Land, is only a few hours away.”_

SHROUD is a survival game where you can exchange body parts with robots for food and weapons. Doing so will make the game harder, but will give you money to buy food and resources. Will you survive?

Your goal is to find the gates of **New Nuric** and escape the wasteland.

You can sleep in your RV to recover health, thirst and hunger. The game is still not balanced around this mechanic so for the optimal experience don't exploit it.

Use healthpacks to heal, radaways to get rid of radiations and food and water to survive.
